Yo ðŸ‘‹,

Nothing realy interesting to say about myself. I like to write something ocassionaly every now and then although I don't put them here. I used to game hard but now I just spend majority of my day studying or talking to people

## online relationships aren't real
You are wasting your time.

hello im a sads person with a anime avatar, i have nine friends and i link my equally as degenerate significant other on my profile with a unicode heart
my name is minimalistic and ominous, if you insult me, i'll dox you and then bask in my silent glory

i am a neet with no ambitions, my parents hate me, i dropped out of high school, and im a self proclaimed genius, but i never express it
my favorite five groups are "/d/ is for dickgirls", "sad sleepy anime", "sleep forever", "thigh high lolis" and a group where the only members are me and my significant other, set to invite only

my significant other is monotoned, yet girly sounding, anorexic, and shy, we sleep skype together and go on skype dates, i love them so much as i hug my parent's ipad tightly,drifting away at 2 am.

Online relationships are insignificant.
How many of you have been in online relationships, with promises of hopes and pipe dreams. You imagine yourselves together and moving between state (or country LOL). You think to yourself "This person with an anime avatar is the one i'm going to spend the rest of my life with".

Are you both socially and economically well off?  
   1.) Do you both hold careers or have skills that you can make an affordable wage?  
   2.) Do you both really trust each other enough to not think they're cheating every 5 minutes?  
   3.) Are you willing to make sacrifices to your free time to work extra or finish school?

Well, just know that it's most likely not going to work.
